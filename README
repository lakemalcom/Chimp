Chimp uses screen to talk to external interpreters. The basic screen driver
is language agnostic and is intended to be used as backend for filetype
plugins, which comprise the intelligence of the system.

An example filetype plugin for Clojure is included. There are several ways
to extract code and send it to a running Clojure in a screen.

The coupling is very loose on purpose! Eg. one can send from several Vims
to the same screen. However this leads to a certain fragileness. The Clojure
plugin takes care of automatically switching namespaces for the different
files being edited. However, nothing prevents the user from interacting
with the REPL directly messing up the namespace sync between Chimp in Vim
and Clojure.

Chimp should also work on Windows with Cygwin.

You will also need the VimClojure filetype plugin for
the Clojure frontend.
