ClojureChimp
============

Introduction
------------

ClojureChimp is a filetype plugin for Clojure, which extracts Clojure code as
requested by the user and submits it to a running Chimp. For further
information have look at |chimp.txt|.

In case the file defines a namespace, the namespace is automatically switched
before submitting code for evaluation. Is no namespace defined with (in-ns)
the namespace 'user will be assumed.
